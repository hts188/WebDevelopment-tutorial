    <p style="border: 2px solid green">This is also a Paragraph</p>

    <span style="border: 2px solid blue">This is a Paragraph</span><span style="border: 2px solid magenta">This is also
        a paragraph but in same line</span>
    <!-- <span></span> is a inline element this means they dont take full space.
